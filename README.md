3-D models describing possible ways the polaroplast is folded and organized inside Encephalitozoon intestinalis spores.

These models serve as supplementary information for the manuscript entited: "Cryo-ET reveals the architecture of dormant microsporidian spores" (publication info:xxxx). These models can be sliced and compared to tomograms by using chimeraâ€™s Side View, accessible in Tools -> Viewing Controls -> Side View


There are three main directories:

1- Polaroplast_Long,
    subfolders: Polaroplast_model1,
                Polaroplast_model2,
                Polaroplast_model3,
                Polaroplast_model4,
                Polaroplast_model5,
                Polaroplast_model6,
                Other_Spore_Organelles.
                
2- Polaroplast_Short,
    subfolders: Polaroplast_model1,
                Polaroplast_model2,
                Polaroplast_model3,
                Polaroplast_model4,
                Polaroplast_model5,
                Polaroplast_model6,
                Other_Spore_Organelles.
                
3- PT_model

Each model is deposited in a '.stl' file format which can be opened in chimera.

Regarding the polaroplast models deposited in folders 1 and 2, we recommend opening the model of interest with the spore organelles deposited in the Other_Spore_Organelles folder to see an overall picture of spore organization. 

Note: These models will appear grey by default and the color of each model can be adjusted using the command line, accessible in Favorites -> Command Line. On the command line enter the code: color #XXXXXX #ID, where XXXXXX = hex color code and ID = the ID of the model as indicated in the model panel (Favorites -> Model Panel). 

The color codes used in the manuscript are as follows: 
Exospore: e3170a,
Endospore: ffd12a, 
Plasma Membrane: 00aa00, 
Anchoring Disc: ff8800, 
Polaroplast: aa55ff,
Nucleus: ffaaff, 
Polar Tube (M-layer): 8b6fff,
Polar Tube (OF-Layer): 13ccff,
Polar Tube (IF - Layer): faf28b,
Polar Tube (Core): ffbb7d,
Vacuole : c19a6b.
